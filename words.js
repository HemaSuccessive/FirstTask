Find if a word can be formed by two words in a dictionary. For example, find that "newspaper" can be made by "news" and "paper." Write an effective program to do this assuming you have an array of words as a dictionary in ascending order?


const words = ['hello','world'];
const words1=['news','papers'];
console.log(words.join(' '));
console.log(words1.join(' '));

Output
helloworld
newspaper
